        <h1>When to Wear Ties</h1>
        <p>Weddings: A white shirt under a striped silver tie and light grey suit will look clean and elegant for the special occasion.</p>
        <p>The act of marriage is slowly turning the arc from formal to casual as time goes on. That doesn’t mean you can
         wear jeans and shirt with no tie. If there is no mention of dress code on the invite, consider a suit and tie mandatory.</p>
        
        <p>Funerals – A funeral aims to fulfill two purposes. The first is to honour and celebrate the passing of
           a loved one. The second is to pay tribute and offer your respect. Dressing formally in a black suit complete
            with tie is one way of showing that.</p>

        <p>Fine Dining: Opt for ties with stripes or solid colours but if you’re still in doubt then go formal with a “black tie” dress code.</p>
        
        <p>Job Interviews: A striped blue tie on a solid blue shirt will make you look professional. If you want to look extra suave
           then why not add a tie clip?</p>
        
        <p>Business / Corporate Events – It doesn’t matter if it’s a holiday party or an annual town hall. 
          Your goal should be to always dress how your superiors dress. Unless you work at Facebook, don’t 
          be wearing any hoodies to a business event.
        </p>

        <p>Dates: A shirt paired with a red or burgundy tie and grey waistcoat is the perfect smart casual look.</p>
        <p>This one is a grey area and rightfully so. There are many places you can take a girl such as
           the local coffee shop to a nice dinner at a new hot spot that you do not need a tie. My advice is to 
           wear a tie if going out for drinks at a bar or having dinner at a an upscale restaurant. You should 
           basically wear a tie at any place that has an upscale vibe.</p>
        
        <p>Meeting New People: A neutral coloured tie such as grey over a white crisp shirt should do the job.</p>
        
        <p>Networking Events: We’d opt for a yellow tie so that you’ll not only stand out amongst a crowd of people, 
            but you’ll also appear more approachable, positive and friendly.</p>
        <p>Whenever you’re in an event where interacting with people is the norm then
           first impressions will matter. You can get away with wearing a blazer with a shirt and no tie 
           but why not set your bar high? Be the man other’s want to live up to and dress the best you can. 
           Wearing a tie to a networking event is the smart choice.</p>

        <h2>Ties for Job Interviews</h2>
        <p>Depending on what type of job you are applying for, it may be suitable for you to wear a skinny tie. 
          Skinny ties may be popular in fashion but you aren’t going to a catwalk, you are going to a job interview. 
          There’s a fine line between looking good and feeling good and it’s best not to cross that boundary. 

          It is recommended to wear a regular tie at all times because it gives off a more professional look. 
          For job interviews, you should stick with diagonal stripes, solids or minute patterned ties.
        </p>
        <p>
          Does Color Matter? 
          
           Depending on the type of color tie you wear, you can hint to your employer what kind of personality you have.
        <p>    
          Red: It’s called the power tie for a reason, and by wearing a red tie you are implying that you mean
           business.  Just like Tiger Woods wears a red shirt to convey dominance, the red tie is a reaffirmation
           of strength, authority and dominance within the professional world.  For a less aggressive approach, 
           switch out your vibrant red for a softer shade of burgundy. 
           A dominant color that symbolizes wealth, passion and victory. If you are going to wear a red tie for 
           your job interview, be sure to express your overwhelming determination.
        </p>
        <br>
        <p>
          Blue: Conveying trust, stability and confidence a blue tie is perfect for client facing or public speaking.
           That being said, it’s no coincidence that politicians and salesmen are frequently seen in blue ties. 
           The lighter blue shade is softer and appears more approachable.  A darker shade of blue represents seriousness 
           and matter-of-factness. 
           A serene color that symbolizes peace and persistence. If you are going to wear a blue tie for your
           job interview, be ready to express that you are a hardworking individual.
        </p>
        <br>
        <p>Green: This color symbolizes practicality, reliability and implies being down-to-earth. Brighter shades of 
            green will imply that you are balanced, fresh and energetic. For a conventional look, darker shades of green 
            are more appropriate and will imply that you are stable and serious.
        </p>
        <br>
        <p>
          Yellow: Yellow is the approachable cousin of the power tie.  While still conveying authority,
           intelligence and positivity, yellow is the subtle version of a red power tie.  This is the 
           perfect tie to wear for a first interview, because it shows you are confident and not afraid of a challenge.
           A radiant color that symbolizes exuberance and creativity. If you are going to wear a yellow tie for your 
           job interview, be sure to express your jovial and outgoing personality.
        </p>
        <br>
        <p>Orange: is the wild card of tie colors.  A bright orange tie will imply that you are enthusiastic, 
            open-minded and adventurous.  It is the perfect tie for making a memorable first impression and creating 
            a sense of excitement within the workplace.</p>
        <br>
        <p>Black: A black tie should only be worn during formal events and special occasions.</p>
