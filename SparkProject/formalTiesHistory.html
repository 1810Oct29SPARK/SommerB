        <h1>The History of Ties</h1>
      <div>Most sartorialists agree that the necktie originated in the 17th century, during the 30 year
           war in France. King Louis XIII hired Croatian mercenaries (see picture above) who wore a piece
           of cloth around their neck as part of their uniform. While these early neckties did serve a function
           (tying the top of their jackets that is), they also had quite a decorative effect – a look that King
           Louis was quite fond of. In fact, he liked it so much that he made these ties a mandatory accessory 
           for Royal gatherings, and – to honor the Croatian soldiers – he gave this clothing piece the name 
           “La Cravate” – the name for necktie in French to this day.</div>
        <br><br><br>
        <div>The early cravats of the 17th century have little resemblance to today’s necktie,
           yet it was a style that stayed popular throughout Europe for over 200 years.
           The tie as we know it today did not emerge until the 1920s but since then has undergone
           many (often subtle) changes. Because lots of change has happened to the design of the tie
           in the past century each; shown broken down for each decade: </div>

          <p>
            The tie was a must-have clothing accessories for men in the first decade of the 20th century.
            Most common were Cravats which evolved from the early 17th century ties that were brought to
            France by the Croatians. What was different however, was how they were tied.
            Two decades earlier, the Four in Hand knot had been invented which was the only knot used for cravats.
            While other tie knots have been invented since, the Four in Hand is still one of the most
            popular tie knots today. The two other common neckwear styles popular at the time were bow ties
            (used for evening white tie attire), as well as ascots (required for formal day time dress in England).
          </p>
          <br><br>
          <li class="liHistory">1910-1919</li>
          <p>
            The second decade of the 20th century saw a decline in formal cravats and ascots as men’s fashion
            became more casual with haberdashers putting a stronger emphasis on comfort, functionality, and fit.
            Towards the end of this decade neckties closely resemble the ties as we know them today.
          </p>

          <li class="liHistory">1920-1929</li>
          <p>
            The 1920s were an important decade for men’s ties. A NY tie maker by the name of Jessie Langsdorf
            invented a new way of cutting the fabric when constructing a tie, which allowed the tie to spring 
            back into its original shape after each wearing. This invention triggered the creation of many new 
            tie knots. Neckties became the predominant choice for men as bow ties were reserved for formal 
            evening and black tie functions. Furthermore, for the first time, repp-stripe and British regimental 
            ties emerged.
          <br><br>
          <li class="liHistory">1930-1939</li>
          <p>
            During the Art Deco movement of the 1930s, neckties became wider and often displayed bold Art Deco 
            patterns and designs. Men also wore their ties a bit shorter and commonly tied them with a Windsor 
            knot – a tie knot that the Duke of Windsor invented during this time.
          </p>
          <br><br>
          <li class="liHistory">1940-1949</li>
          <p>
            The early part of the 1940s didn’t offer any exciting change in the world of men’s ties – possibly an 
            effect of WWII which had people worry about more important things than clothing and fashion. When WWII 
            ended in 1945 however, a feeling of liberation became evident in design and fashion. Colors on ties 
            became bold, patterns stood out, and one retailer by the name of Grover Chain Shirt Shop even created 
            a necktie collection displaying sparsely dressed women.
          </p>

          <li class="liHistory">1950-1959</li>
          <p>
            When talking about ties, the 50s are most famous for the emergence of the skinny tie – a style designed 
            to compliment the more form fitting and tailored clothes of the time. Additionally tie makers started 
            experimenting with different materials.
          </p>
          <br><br>
          <li class="liHistory">1960-1969</li>
          <p>
            Just as ties were put on a diet in the 50s, the 1960s went to the other extreme – creating some of the 
            widest neckties ever. Ties as wide as 6 inches were not uncommon – a style that got the name “Kipper Tie”
          </p>
          <br><br>
          <li class="liHistory">1970-1979</li>
          <p>
            The disco movement of the 1970s truly embraced the ultra wide “Kipper Tie”. But also worth noting is the 
            creation of the Bolo Tie (aka Western Tie) which became Arizona’s official state neckwear in 1971.
          </p>
          <br><br>
          <li class="liHistory">1980-1989</li>
          <p>
            The 1980s are certainly not known for great fashion. Instead of embracing a certain style, tie makers 
            created any kind of neck-wear style during this period. Ultra-wide “Kipper Ties” were still present to 
            some degree as was the re-emergence of the skinny tie which was often made from leather.
          </p>
          <br><br>
          <li class="liHistory">1990-1999</li>
          <p>
            By 1990 the style Faux Pas of the 80s slowly faded away. Neckties became a bit more uniform in width 
            (3.75-4 inches). Most popular were bold floral and paisley patterns – a style that has recently resurfaced 
            as a popular print on modern ties today.
          </p>
          <br><br>
          <li class="liHistory">2000-2009</li>
          <p>
            Compared the the decade before ties became a bit thinner at about 3.5-3.75 inches. European designers 
            further shrunk the width and eventually the skinny tie re-emerged as a popular stylish accessory.
          </p>
          <br><br>
          <li class="liHistory">2010–Current Day</li>
          <p>
            Today, ties are available in many widths, cuts, fabrics, and patterns. It is all about choice and allowing 
            the modern man to express his own personal style. The standard width for ties is still in the 3.25-3.5 inch 
            range, but to fill the gap to the skinny tie (1.5-2.5″), many designers now offer narrow ties that are about 
            2.75-3 inches wide. Besides the width, unique fabrics, weaves, and patterns emerged. Knitted ties became 
            popular in 2011 and 2012 saw a strong trend of bold florals and paisleys – something that continued throughout 
            2013.
